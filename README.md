### GitHubAPI

This is a project to learn me some web development skills and use the
GitHub API. 

I have two ideas that I might make something out of. The first, is
inspired by https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9712240. To create
an automated list of all of the GitHub pages blogs by searching everyone's
repositories for ones that meet the format. Then I could sort them by 
popularity or something. The second is to solve 
http://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/75027/ and display it using javascript.
